- **Sarah, the Salesperson:**

  - **Goal:** To quickly and accurately capture client orders and provide them with timely price quotes to facilitate trades.
  - **Frustrations:** Cumbersome order entry systems that slow her down and the inability to see the status of her orders in real-time.
  - **Needs:** A fast and intuitive order entry screen, clear communication with the trading desk, and visibility into the entire lifecycle of her orders.

- **Tom, the Trader:**

  - **Goal:** To manage the risk of his book, execute trades at the best possible prices, and maximize profitability.
  - **Frustrations:** Inefficient workflows, lack of integrated views of his positions and P&L, and difficulty in managing a high volume of orders.
  - **Needs:** A powerful workspace to monitor his positions and risk in real-time, seamless integration with order management, and flexible pricing tools.

- **Alex, the Trader Assistant:**
  - **Goal:** To support the trader by handling the operational aspects of trading, such as order allocation, trade booking, and ensuring data accuracy.
  - **Frustrations:** Manual and repetitive tasks, dealing with trade discrepancies, and lack of automation.

### Scenario 1: The Morning Rush - A Salesperson's Workflow

**Scenario:** It's a busy morning, and Sarah, the salesperson, has a client on the phone who wants to buy a specific bond. She needs to quickly capture the order, get a price from the trading desk, and confirm the trade with the client.

#### Storyboard

| Step                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Image |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- |
| **1. The Call**                 | Sarah is on the phone with a client who wants to buy 10 million of a specific corporate bond.                                                                                                                                                                              |       |
| **2. Launching the Ticket**     | Sarah quickly launches the **Ticket** screen from her desktop. She can do this as a standalone application.                                                                                                                                                                |       |
| **3. Capturing the Order**      | Sarah enters the bond's identifier (CUSIP), the client's name, the quantity (10mm), and the side (Buy). The system automatically populates some fields based on pre-configured settings.                                                                                   |       |
| **4. Requesting a Price**       | The order is for a bond that requires a trader's price. Sarah clicks the "Request Price" button, which sends the order to the trader's queue. The order status on her ticket changes to "Pending Price."                                                                   |       |
| **5. Trader's Action**          | Tom, the trader, sees the new order appear on his **Workspace** in the "Incoming Orders" blotter. He reviews the order, checks his current position in that bond, and decides on a price. He enters the price on his version of the **Ticket** and sends it back to Sarah. |       |
| **6. Confirming the Trade**     | Sarah sees the price appear on her **Ticket**. She relays the price to the client. The client agrees. Sarah clicks "Confirm" to finalize the trade. The order status changes to "Filled."                                                                                  |       |
| **7. Trade Appears on Blotter** | The new trade instantly appears on Tom's **Workspace** in the "Trades" blotter, and his position in the bond is updated in the "Positions" blotter.                                                                                                                        |       |

### Scenario 2: Setting the Stage - The Trader Assistant's Pricing Setup

**Scenario:** Alex, the trader assistant, needs to set up a new pricing rule for a set of bonds that will be actively traded today. The trader wants these bonds to be priced based on a spread to a benchmark Treasury bond.

#### Storyboard

| Step                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                              | Image |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- |
| **1. The Request**                  | Tom, the trader, asks Alex to set up matrix pricing for a list of investment-grade corporate bonds.                                                                                      |       |
| **2. Launching the Pricing Screen** | Alex opens the **Pricing** screen.                                                                                                                                                       |       |
| **3. Creating a New Rule**          | Alex clicks "New Rule" and selects "Matrix Price" as the rule type.                                                                                                                      |       |
| **4. Defining the Rule**            | Alex defines the rule: he selects the list of bonds, chooses the benchmark Treasury bond, and sets the yield spread. He also sets the effective date and time for the rule.              |       |
| **5. Saving the Rule**              | Alex saves the new pricing rule. The system validates the rule and adds it to the list of active pricing rules.                                                                          |       |
| **6. The Rule in Action**           | Later, an order for one of these bonds comes in from a salesperson. The **Ticket** automatically populates the price based on the matrix pricing rule Alex created.                      |       |
| **7. Trader's Discretion**          | The trader can see that the price was auto-filled by the pricing rule. They have the option to override the price manually on the **Ticket** if they disagree with the rule-based price. |       |

#### Use Cases

**Use Case 2.1: Create a Matrix Pricing Rule**

- **Actor:** Trader Assistant (Alex)
- **Preconditions:** The user has the necessary permissions to create pricing rules.
- **Trigger:** The trader requests a new pricing setup for a set of bonds.
- **Main Success Scenario:**
  1.  The user opens the **Pricing** screen.

  4.  The user selects the benchmark bond and enters the price or yield offset.
  5.  The user sets the effective date and time.
  6.  The user saves the rule.
  7.  The system validates and activates the rule.
- **Extensions:**
  - **4a. Invalid Benchmark Bond:** If the selected benchmark bond is not valid, the system displays an error.
  - **6a. Overlapping Rules:** If the new rule conflicts with an existing rule for the same bond, the system prompts the user to resolve the conflict (e.g., by prioritizing one rule or deactivating the old one).

### Scenario 3: A Holistic View - The Trader's Workspace

**Scenario:** Tom, the trader, wants to get a comprehensive view of his book. He wants to see his current positions, his trading activity for the day, and key performance metrics, all in one place.

#### Storyboard

| Step                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Image |

| **2. Creating a Blotter**   | Tom wants to create a new view for his high-yield corporate bond book. He clicks "New Blotter" and selects the books he wants to include.                                                                           |       |
| **3. Configuring the View** | Tom configures the blotter to show two grids: one for his current positions and one for today's trades. He adds columns for P&L, market value, and duration to the positions grid.                                  |       |
| **4. Live Updates**         | Throughout the day, as trades are executed, Tom's **Workspace** updates in real-time. He sees his positions change, new trades appear in the trades grid, and his P&L fluctuate with market movements.              |       |
| **5. Drilling Down**        | Tom notices a large unrealized loss on one of his positions. He double-clicks on the position to bring up a detailed view, showing all the trades that make up that position.                                       |       |
| **6. Integrated Workflow**  | A new order arrives from a salesperson. It appears in a dedicated "Incoming Orders" panel within his **Workspace**. He can click on the order to open the **Ticket** and take action without leaving his main view. |       |
